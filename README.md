A way to automize normalizing of bpm's for stepmania charts
This project was made to have a quick and easy way of normalizing charts that go all over the place with bpm's


**! ISSUES WITH SYNC WILL BE WORSENED WITH THIS, ONLY USE PROPERLY SYNCED CHARTS !**

Application was only tested on windows using python 3, it will most likely break on other operating systems due to file managers

Dependencies: pydub, ffmpeg
